Linters make sure your code has a uniform style, to make it easier to read and to catch mistakes early. But installing a file linter or style checker usually requires a lot of configuration to set up the particular style rules that you want to follow. Some linters might have presets to make things easier, but these presets will also need to be configured before the tool can be used.
